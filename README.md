🔐 EncryptX
EncryptX is a web-based tool that allows users to input text or upload files and benchmark multiple encryption algorithms to determine the most efficient and suitable one based on performance metrics like encryption/decryption speed, size, and security levels.

🚀 Features
✅ Text & File Input Support – Encrypt any plain text or upload files directly.

🧪 Benchmark Multiple Algorithms – Compare popular encryption algorithms such as AES, DES, RSA, Blowfish, and more.

📊 Real-time Performance Metrics – Measure encryption/decryption time, output size, and processing efficiency.

🧠 Future AI Integration – Coming soon: AI-powered recommendations based on data type, size, and usage context.

🌐 User-Friendly Interface – Responsive and intuitive UI for smooth user experience.

📂 How It Works
Choose Input Type: Enter text manually or upload a file of any format like pdf,txt or img.

Select Algorithms: Pick one or more algorithms to benchmark.

Run Benchmark: Let EncryptX process and show encryption & decryption stats.

Review Results: Analyze timing, efficiency, and best-suited algorithm.
